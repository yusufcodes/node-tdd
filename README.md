# api-tdd

Practice repo for using Test Driven Development in a basic Node & Express app

## TDD: How it works

1) Write a test, which will fail initially
2) Start implementing the code until the test passes - as simple as possible
3) Refactor to improve the code

This app mocks a basic 'To Do List' api as an example to practice TDD with.

## Testing Tools
- Supertest: to be able to make test requests to the API
- Jest: writing test assertions
