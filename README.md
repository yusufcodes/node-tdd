# api-tdd

Practice repo for using Test Driven Development in a basic Node & Express app

## TDD: How it works

1) Write a test, which will fail initially
2) Start implementing the code until the test passes - as simple as possible
3) Refactor to improve the code

## Tests to practice in this app
- GET: getting all TODOs
- GET: getting TODO by specific ID
- POST: creating a TODO
